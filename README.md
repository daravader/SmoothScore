BJJ Pose and Gesture Recognition

This project is a real-time pose and hand gesture recognition system tailored for Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) training and scoring. Using computer vision and machine learning technologies, the application processes video feeds to identify poses and gestures, and then maps these to predefined BJJ scoring categories.

Key Features:

1. Pose Recognition:

Detects common BJJ stances like "T-pose," "Arms Extended," and "Standing Upright" using MediaPipe's Pose module.
Maps detected poses to BJJ scoring categories such as Finish, Advantage, and Neutral.
2. Hand Gesture Recognition:

Recognizes gestures such as "Thumb Up," "Victory," and "All Fingers Extended" using MediaPipe Hands.
3. Dynamic Camera Support:

Default setup uses the device's camera.
Users can switch to an IP camera feed dynamically during runtime.
Frames are processed at a steady FPS to ensure a smooth video feed, even with complex calculations. Camera resolution is set to 1280x720 for enhanced clarity.
4. Optimized Performance:

Frames are processed at a steady FPS to ensure a smooth video feed, even with complex calculations.
Camera resolution is set to 1280x720 for enhanced clarity.
5. User-Friendly GUI:

Simple buttons for starting, stopping, and switching between camera sources.
Real-time display of pose, gestures, and BJJ scoring annotations directly on the video feed.
Purpose and Applications:

This project serves as a training tool for athletes and coaches in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, providing insights into body positioning and scoring potential in real time. Additionally, it showcases the integration of advanced computer vision techniques with a user-friendly interface, making it adaptable for other sports or gesture recognition applications.

USAGE:

Install the needed libraries ("pip install opencv-python mediapipe"). Other libraries should be installed with python latest version. Then the program should run seamlessly.
